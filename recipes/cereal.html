    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Minimum effort, most satisfiying meal of the bunch. Nothing like a bowl of artifical sugars and dairy to enjoy after a long hard working depression episode. Oatmeals are too much effort anyway.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A brand of cereal of your choice</li>
        <li>Any amount of milk or milk substitute of your choice</li>
        <li>1 <strong>LARGE</strong> bowl</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em>A comically large spoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your <strong>LARGE</strong> bowl.</li>
        <li>Grab your cereal of choice and pour out to your hearts content.</li>
        <li>Do the same with the milk of your choice. Be careful not to pour too much to overflow the bowl.</li>
    </ol>
