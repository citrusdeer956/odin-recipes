            <p>I compiled a list of meals for folks who are going through hard times emotionally (maybe even finanically!)</p>
            <p>Dedicated to my wonderful and supportive girlfriend, who is also an keen expert on <strong>true depression meals with minimum effort.</strong> You keep me strong enough to put more effort even in my meals!</p>

            <h3>RULES:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Must require minimum effort to create. Less dishware, the better!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example: Any usage of a stovetop disqualifies the qualification of a depression meal.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Meal should not go over the budget of $4 per meal.</li>
                <li>The more pathetic, the better!</li>
                <li>Typically should not take more than three steps to create. Five is pushing it!</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
